# Application Tokens

Application tokens are those issued and traded on RDDLs Planetmint network ([SLIP44:  PLMNT, 8680 \[Symbol, ID\]](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md)) by the machines and their operators. Application tokens can be fungible or non-fungible.&#x20;

Non-fungible application tokens can, e.g. represent a set of data to be tokenized or other unique aspects.&#x20;

Fungible application tokens can be used to create tradable asset classes like kilowatt-hours. These can be used in a single application to model economics between users and entities. In other use cases, these tokens could be utilized between machines and applications.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Application tokens cannot only be traded as a whole. That means that someone can have five application tokens of the same type, e.g. one can be transferred, but an application token can't be fractionalized further. Only integer values are accepted.
{% endhint %}

The value of the application tokens is derived from underlying secure HW concepts and is built around the following values

* guarantee of data provenance,
* signal integrity,
* relevance, and
* value consistency.
