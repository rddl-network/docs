# Asset Tokens

Asset tokens are traded on the Liquid network ([SLIP44:  LBTC, 998 \[Symbol, ID\]](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md)) and can be fractionalized. The [machine attestation process](../../use-cases/machine-attestation.md) allows operators to issue asset tokens for the given machine.&#x20;

The issued tokens will be given to the issuer wallet of the machine.&#x20;

Asset tokens can be traded and are designed to represent the value of the machine and its productivity. Different use cases like micro-investments can be utilized with that and will be explained in the [use case section](broken-reference) in the future.

Per strict definition, machines are non-fungible. However, machines become re-fungible by tokenizing them, i.e. digitising them as assets, turning them into a digital twin, and issuing attributes and claims on top of them, as the tokens representing them can be bought, sold or exchanged.&#x20;

The versatility of the token can represent&#x20;

* the whole asset as such,
* fractional ownership,
* fractional drawing and utility rights,
* access and usage rights,
* claims and certificates of any kind,
* proof of provenance,
* proof of non-hazardous materials,
* enable a broad portfolio of new business developments around machines

, otherwise not possible.&#x20;

Some concepts that can - amongst others - be built around the asset token are traditional

* bonds
* loans
* options
* futures

others more decentralized

* staking
* voting
* flash loans
