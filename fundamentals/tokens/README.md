# ðŸª™ Tokens

### Token Definitions

1. [**RDDL**](rddl-token.md) is the **registry token**. Some refer to this as the â€˜incentiveâ€™ token.
2. [**Asset tokens** ](asset-tokens.md)can be issued during machine attestation. These tokens are issued on the Liquid Network and
   * can be fungible or non-fungible,
   * have a configurable economic value,
   * can be referred to as synthetic tokens.
3. [**Application Tokens**](application-tokens.md) can be issued and generated by participating machines at any time. Their economics are up to the machine operators, their purposes and their definitions. These tokens can&#x20;
   * be fungible or non-fungible,
   * contain the metadata generated by machines, per machine owner discretion,
   * have economic value within the application being built by machine owners (based on the type of metadata stored)
4. Tokens from other networks can be wrapped as Liquid Tokens. They are called [**wrapped tokens**](wrapped-tokens.md)**.**
   * example: Ocean ERC (ETH) token 1:1 wrapped on Liquid via â€˜escrowâ€™ account
