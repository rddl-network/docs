### Token Definitions

1. [**RDDL**](rddl-token.md) is the **registry token**. Some refer to this as the â€˜incentiveâ€™ token.
2. [**Machine Identity Token**](../../basics/tokens/machine-identity-token.md) is issued on planetmint during the machine attestation process. The extended public key of the machine is notarized. Another type is also added.
3. [**RDDL Purpose Tokens**](../../basics/tokens/rddl-purpose-tokens.md) are issued on Liquid Network by 3rd parties (economic actors) and used to interact economically with machines.
4. [**CID Assets**](../../basics/tokens/cid-assets.md) are issued on planetmint,
   * are non-fungible,
   * and contain machine-generated metadata, per the machine owner's discretion.
5. Tokens from other networks can be wrapped as Liquid Tokens. They are called [**wrapped tokens**](wrapped-tokens.md)**.**
   * example: Ocean ERC (ETH) token 1:1 wrapped on Liquid via â€˜escrowâ€™ account
