# ðŸ›  Getting started

In order to start working with the network a machines has to be given an identity and attested to the network thereafter.&#x20;

The process of identity creation is called provisioning.

{% content-ref url="machine-provisioning.md" %}
[machine-provisioning.md](machine-provisioning.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The machine can be attested to the network (registered) after it has been provisioned.

{% content-ref url="machine-attestation.md" %}
[machine-attestation.md](machine-attestation.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Validators are attested in a specific way. This is mentioned on that pager here:

{% content-ref url="validator-attestation.md" %}
[validator-attestation.md](validator-attestation.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
