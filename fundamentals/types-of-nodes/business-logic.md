# ðŸ‘©ðŸ’¼ Business Logic

Generic requirements about the way nodes interact with RDDL-Network are defined at [REP-4](https://github.com/rddl-network/REPs/tree/main/REP-4).

The business logic takes care of data collection, notarization and storage to prove the Proof of Productivity.

Amongst others, the logic has to satisfy all the needs of other business models built on top of the application token and the notarized data.&#x20;

In general, customers and machine operators can integrate&#x20;

* the distribution of arbitrary token revenues (RDDL, asset, application, or wrapped tokens) to their shareholders/beneficiaries
* [application tokens ](../tokens/application-tokens.md)
* distribution of [asset tokens](../tokens/asset-tokens.md)
