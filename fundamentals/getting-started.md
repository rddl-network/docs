# ðŸ›  Getting started

To start working with the network, a machine must be given an identity and attested to the network afterwards.&#x20;

The process of identity creation is called provisioning.

[machine-provisioning.md](../use-cases/machine-provisioning.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The machine can be attested to the network (registered) after it has been provisioned.

{% content-ref url="../use-cases/machine-attestation.md" %}
[machine-attestation.md](../use-cases/machine-attestation.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Validators are attested in a specific way. This is mentioned on that page here:

{% content-ref url="../use-cases/validator-attestation.md" %}
[validator-attestation.md](../use-cases/validator-attestation.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
