# Getting connected

This documentation targets technology-savvy people and guides them through a step-by-step guide on connecting their devices to the RDDL Testnet.

The process of attaching a device to the network up to the point of being able to participate in PoP is staged as follows:

1. Flashing RDDL-compatible Firmware to the devices of choice (see [RDDL-Compatible devices](https://docs.rddl.io/rddl-network/supported-hardware/rddl-compatible-devices)).
2. Configuring the node (e.g. [Tasmota Node configuration](../use-cases/tasmoda-node-configuration.md))
3. Attesting the node (automated right now, will become a non-automated process on Tasmota soon)

Your node should be part of the RDDL
