# Participating in the RDDL Network

The RDDL Network's interest is to onboard various types of machines to the network and the protocol. RDDL has a reference implementation of Tasmota, which is maintained and managed at [https://github.com/rddl-network/Tasmota](https://github.com/rddl-network/Tasmota).

Every machine needs to go through the following process:

1. Register the machine ID to the network
2. Attest the machine to the network
3. Notarize CIDs/assets & participate in the Proof of Productivity

**What is the Machine ID?**

The machine ID is a unique private/public key pair on your firmware or Secure Element of your Trust Anchor.

The section [How to register your Machine ID](how-to-register-your-machine-id.md) guides you through the process of Machine ID registration. The section [Hardware: Planetmint & Service Interaction](hardware-planetmint-and-service-interaction/) shows the network and service interactions depending on the machine type that you come with.&#x20;
