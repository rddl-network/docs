# âš¡ Energy Tracker (FW to be made)

> The Energy Tracker is powered by an **ESP32-C6** chip and features a built-in IR sensor for reading and writing data to and from a Smart Meter. It also includes a USB Type-C port and an M-Bus connector. The device is equipped with two AAA batteries for easy replacement and a long battery life. The SE050 provides the necessary cryptographic hardware framework to comply with cryptographic primitives.

> Thanks to Zigbee technology, the device can connect to a corresponding Zigbee Coordinator, which acts as a bridge between the Zigbee Tracker and Wi-Fi. The Zigbee Coordinator, in turn, is powered by 230V mains.
