# üîå Shelly Plus Plug S

   3.  Configure the Shelly Plus Plug S WiFi by providing the SSID and password to your local WiFi.&#x20;

       Once the Shelly Plus Plug S connects to your local WiFi, you can see the device's IP address on the dashboard, and from now on, you can connect to Shelly Plus Plug S by entering this IP address on your browser.

       If you were unable to see the IP address,&#x20;

       1. the IP address can be looked up on your router
       2.  or via a network sniffing app for your OS.
