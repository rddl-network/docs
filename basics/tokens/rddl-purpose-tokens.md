# RDDL Purpose Tokens

RDDL Purpose Tokens (RPT) are traded on the Liquid network ([SLIP44:  LBTC, 998 \[Symbol, ID\]](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md)) and can be fractionalized. The Liquid network allows 3rd parties to issue tokens. The purpose of the tokens is up to the issuer and might most likely be of the following kind:

* incentive
* shareholder&#x20;
* loan
* bond

### Incentive tokens

Incentive tokens are usually exchanged for machine data and transferred to the addresses of machines participating in the PoP. Data is handed over in exchange, or access to data is granted.

### Shareholder tokens

Shareholder tokens are usually issued by node owners/operators that let shareholders participate in the rewards of the productivity of their node.



The issued tokens are not limited to the abovementioned purposes but can reflect other purposes. Some of them are sketched and mentioned here:

* fractional ownership,
* fractional drawing and utility rights,
* access and usage rights,
* claims and certificates of any kind,
* proof of provenance,
* proof of non-hazardous materials,
* enable a broad portfolio of new business developments around machines
* can be fungible or non-fungible,
* have a configurable economic value
* and can be referred to as synthetic tokens

Some concepts that can - amongst others - be built around the RDDL Purpose Tokens are traditional

* bonds
* loans
* options
* futures

others more decentralized

* staking
* voting
* flash loans
