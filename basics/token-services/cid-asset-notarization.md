# CID Asset Notarization

CID assets are notarized and traded on RDDLs Planetmint network ([SLIP44:  PLMNT, 8680 \[Symbol, ID\]](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md)) by the participating machines. CID assets are non-fungible.&#x20;

Non-fungible CID Assets can e.g. represent a set of data to be tokenized or other unique aspects.&#x20;

The notarization process is based from underlying secure HW concepts and is built around the following values

* guarantee of data provenance,
* signal integrity,
* relevance, and
* value consistency.
