# âŒš Clearance Process

The clearance process, which is executed once a day, aims to reduce transaction fees on Liquid. It consists of two steps: the reissuance and distribution of the RDDL tokens to the DAO, PoP, and investor wallets.

More details about this process are provided on the [Reissance & Distribution](../../reissuance-and-distribution.md) page.
