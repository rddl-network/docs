# âŒš Clearance Process

Reducing transaction fees on Liquid is the purpose of the clearance process. The clearance process is executed once a day. It contains two steps: the reissuance and distribution of the RDDL tokens to the DAO, PoP and investor wallets.

### Reissuance

Reissuance is triggered periodically (once daily, configurable by the network) by the network. The block proposing validator iterates over all challenges since the last reissuance and computes the number of tokens to be reissued.&#x20;

The block proposer creates and broadcasts a `ReissueRDDLProposal` message. The network validates the message. The block proposer reissues the calculated tokens once the network confirms the message. After that, the proposer also creates a `ReissueRDDLResult` message with the details about the reissuance. &#x20;

### Distribution

The distribution of the reissued tokens is set to 30 minutes (15 epochs) after the reissuance. The block proposer initializes the distribution by issuing the `DistributionRequest` message. The network validates the message. The block proposer distributes the tokens following the proposal after the network confirms the message. After that, the proposer creates a DistributionResult message with the corresponding transaction IDs and broadcasts the message to the network.
