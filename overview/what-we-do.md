# ðŸ’¡ What we do

## The physical trust stack for Web3

RDDL enables machine owners to attest and connect their machines to the RDDL network. Attested machines can notarize&#x20;

* data
* productivity

and prove

* origin and provenance of the data
* integrity and authenticity of the data

The machines notarize their activities and make their productivity transparent. RDDL network verifies the notarized claims of the devices with the help of the Proof of Productivity (PoP) - the challenge process of the network.

The PoP process establishes trust in the notarized data and verifies the availability of the data. The process implicitly proves provenance and integrity.&#x20;
