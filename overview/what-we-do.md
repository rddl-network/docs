# ðŸ’¡ What we do

## The physical trust stack for Web3

RDDL enables machine owners to attest and connect their machines to RDDL network. Attested machines can notarize&#x20;

* data
* produtivity

and prove

* origin and provenance of the data
* integrity and authenticity of the data

The machines notarize their activites and make their productivity transparent. RDDL network verifies the notarized claims of the machines with the help of the Proof of Productivity (PoP) - the challgen process of the network.

The PoP process establishes the trust into the notarized data and verifies the availability of the data. Provenance and integrity are implicitly proven by the process.&#x20;
