# ðŸ’¡ What we do

## The physical trust stack for Web3

RDDL enables machine owners to attest and connect their machines to the RDDL network. Attested machines can notarize&#x20;

* data
* productivity

and prove

* origin and provenance of the data
* integrity and authenticity of the data

The machines notarize their activities and make their productivity transparent. RDDL network verifies the notarized claims of the devices with the help of the Proof of Productivity (PoP) - the challenge process of the network.

The PoP process establishes trust in the notarized data and verifies the availability of the data. The process implicitly proves provenance and integrity.&#x20;

## Rewards

RDDL network verifies data availability, integrity and authenticity and rewards participants with RDDL tokens after successful PoP participation.

## Connecting economic actors

RDDL network enables economic actors to connect to trustful data sources that can prove the authenticity and integrity of themselves and their data.

## Economic participation

Connecting productive machines and economic actors enables the devices to participate in markets. RDDL networks aim to allow machines to trade their data for RDDL Purpose Tokens.



The development phases of the RDDL Network can be sketched as follows

* enable machines to prove existence, provide data, and participate in the PoP
* Enable 3rd parties to access machine data
* Enable control over sets of devices
