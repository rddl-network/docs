# ðŸ“‹ Connecting your Machine to the Network

### <mark style="color:green;">**Introduction:**</mark>&#x20;

Welcome to the RDDL Network! This guide will help you seamlessly onboard different types of machines to our network and protocol. Our [reference implementation of Tasmota](https://github.com/rddl-network/Tasmota) is a great starting point for your journey. Follow the steps below to integrate your machine into the RDDL Network successfully.

## <mark style="color:green;">**Step 1: Registering Your Machine ID**</mark>

Before your machine can join the RDDL Network, it needs a unique identifier called the Machine ID. This is a private/public key pair in your firmware or the Secure Element of your [Trust Wallet](../rddl-compatible-devices/trust-anchor.md). The Machine ID serves as your machine's passport to the network.

The "How to Register Your Machine ID" section provides a detailed guide to the registration process.



## <mark style="color:green;">**Step 2: Attesting Your Machine to the Network**</mark>

Once your Machine ID is registered, the next step is attestation. Attestation verifies and validates your machine's identity within the RDDL Network, ensuring a secure and trusted connection between your machine and the network.

The attestation process is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the RDDL Network. The relevant section provides detailed instructions on attesting your machine.



## <mark style="color:green;">**Step 3: Notarizing CIDs/Assets & Participating in Proof of Productivity**</mark>

After successful attestation, your machine must notarize CIDs (Content IDs) or assets and actively participate in the Proof of Productivity. This step contributes to the overall efficiency and productivity of the RDDL Network.

Explore the specific guidelines in the documentation to understand how to notarize CIDs and assets and participate in the Proof of Productivity (PoP).

PoP is a peer-to-peer protocol currently executed via MQTT. Participants must connect to the mainnet/testnet MQTT services of rddl.io to participate.&#x20;

Refer to the "Hardware: Planetmint & Service Interaction" section to better understand the network and service interactions based on your machine type. This will provide insights into the intricacies of the RDDL Network and how your machine fits into the larger ecosystem.

By following these steps and leveraging the resources provided, you'll successfully integrate your machines into the RDDL Network, contributing to a robust and productive network environment. Happy onboarding!
