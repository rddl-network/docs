# ðŸ“‹ Connecting your Machine to the Network

### <mark style="color:green;">**Introduction:**</mark>&#x20;

Welcome to the RDDL Network! This guide will help you seamlessly onboard different types of machines to our network and protocol. Our [reference implementation of Tasmota](https://github.com/rddl-network/Tasmota) is a great starting point for your journey. Follow the steps below to successfully integrate your machine into the RDDL Network.

## <mark style="color:green;">**Step 1: Registering Your Machine ID**</mark>

Before your machine can join the RDDL Network, it needs a unique identifier known as the Machine ID. This is essentially a private/public key pair located in your firmware or the Secure Element of your [Trust Anchor](../rddl-compatible-devices/trust-anchor.md). The Machine ID serves as a passport for your machine in the network.

Refer to the "[How to Register Your Machine ID](../../how-to-register-your-machine-id.md)" section for a detailed guide on the registration process.



## <mark style="color:green;">**Step 2: Attesting Your Machine to the Network**</mark>

Once your Machine ID is registered, the next step is attestation. Attestation is the process of verifying and validating your machine's identity within the RDDL Network. This ensures a secure and trusted connection between your machine and the network.

The attestation process is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the RDDL Network. Detailed instructions on attesting your machine can be found in the relevant section.



## <mark style="color:green;">**Step 3: Notarizing CIDs/Assets & Participating in Proof of Productivity**</mark>

After successful attestation, your machine will need to notarize CIDs (Content IDs) or assets and actively participate in the Proof of Productivity. This step contributes to the overall efficiency and productivity of the RDDL Network.

Explore the specific guidelines provided in the documentation to understand how to notarize CIDs and assets and participate in the Proof of Productivity.

For a better understanding of the network and service interactions based on your machine type, refer to the "[Hardware: Planetmint & Service Interaction](broken-reference)" section. This will provide insights into the intricacies of the RDDL Network and how your machine fits into the larger ecosystem.

By following these steps and leveraging the resources provided, you'll successfully integrate your machines into the RDDL Network, contributing to a robust and productive network environment. Happy onboarding!
