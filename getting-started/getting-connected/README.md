# ðŸ¥‚ Getting Connected

This documentation targets technology-savvy people and provides a step-by-step guide for connecting their devices to the RDDL Testnet.

The process of attaching a device to the network up to the point of being able to participate in PoP is staged as follows:

1. Getting an RDDL-compatible firmware (see [Getting a Firmware](getting-a-firmware.md))
2. Flashing RDDL-compatible Firmware to the devices of choice (see [flashing supported Hardware](rddl-compatible-devices/)).
3. Configuring the node (e.g. [Tasmota Node configuration](tasmota-node-configuration.md))
4. [Connecting to the Network](onboarding-machines-to-the-rddl-network/) (automated right now, will become a non-automated process on Tasmota soon)

Your node should be part of the RDDL
