In order to participate a hardware-based machine bundle is needed that is able to measure its energy consumption or production and notarize the above mentioned aspects.

Moreover, the machine bundle needs to be able to execute the protocol and to comply to the protocol.\
This Hardware consists of at least 3 devices combined:
