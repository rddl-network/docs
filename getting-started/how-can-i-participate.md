# ‚ùì How can I participate?

RDDL network wants to enable the notarization of

* data
* productivity
* energy usage/consumption and prove
* origin and provenance
* integrity and authenticity of data.

In order to participate a hardware-based machine is needed that is able to measure its energy consumption or production and notarize the above mentioned aspects.

You need Hardware for participation on the RDDL network. This Hardware will handle the data transmission and notarizing of the data.&#x20;

Moreover, the machine needs to be able to execute the protocol and to comply to the protocol. These requirements are summarized in the compatibility requirements.

Check out the [supported Hardware](getting-connected/rddl-compatible-devices/) section to see if your HW is already supported. If this is not the case have a look at the [Hardware Approval Process](rddl-network-hw-approval-process.md). And start [connecting your Machine](getting-connected/onboarding-machines-to-the-rddl-network/) after being compatible with the network.
