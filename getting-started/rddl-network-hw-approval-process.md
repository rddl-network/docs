# Hardware approval process

The RDDL Network HW approval process takes care about onboarding machiens different to the Tasmota references implementation. The protocol hasn't been completely specified.&#x20;

[Compatibility Requirements](rddl-compatibility-requirements.md) need to be met and the followings steps need to be taken before requesting approval:

* Integrate libRDDL and implement Testnet compatibility.
* Pass the hardware approval and verification process.
* Create [REP-9 PR](https://github.com/rddl-network/REPs/blob/main/rep9.md).
* Apply to become a Certified 3rd Party OEM vendor for RDDL.

The process itself will be hosted and run on github.com via pull request to REP at [https://github.com/rddl-network/REPs/](https://github.com/rddl-network/REPs/).
