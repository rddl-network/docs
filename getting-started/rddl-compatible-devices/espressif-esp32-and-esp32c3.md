# ðŸ”¬ Espressif ESP32 & ESP32C3

RDDL Network currently supports ESP32 and ESP32C3 by [Espressif Systems](https://www.espressif.com/) and compatible microchips. RDDL Network supports these microchips actively by integrating RDDL Network [functionalities, primitives and requirements](../onboarding-machines-to-the-rddl-network/how-to-register-your-machine-id/rddl-compatibility-requirements.md) into a fork of [Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/), the open-source firmware for ESP devices.

The fork can be found at [https://github.com/rddl-network/Tasmota](https://github.com/rddl-network/Tasmota). Official firmware releases are listed at [https://github.com/rddl-network/Tasmota/releases](https://github.com/rddl-network/Tasmota/releases).



A flashing tool for ESP32 and ESP32C3 can be found at [https://github.com/rddl-network/flash\_utils](https://github.com/rddl-network/flash\_utils)
